# Dev-Flashcards

A flashcard-based study platform focused on software engineering concepts and public exam preparation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Dev-Flashcards was created as a practical learning project with two main goals:

- Reinforce key software engineering concepts for public exams.
- Apply frontend and backend architectural principles in a real-world application.

The project evolves incrementally, starting with a frontend MVP and later expanding into a full-stack application.

## 🧠 Study Strategy

The application organizes content by subject areas such as:

- Software Quality
- Agile Methodologies
- SOLID Principles
- Clean Architecture
- Angular
- Other relevant exam topics

Each subject contains concise flashcards designed for quick revision sessions, especially useful for short review periods (e.g., travel time before the exam).
